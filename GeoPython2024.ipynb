    "\n",
    "**Easy, fast and scalable geospatial analysis in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the docs:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in python easier. It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely, providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS."
